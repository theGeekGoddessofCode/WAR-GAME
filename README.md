# WAR-GAME
This is a simple game of War between two players with a deck of cards using the simple concepts of OOP in Python.
I will use Python OOP to simulate a simplified version of the game war.
Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards.
